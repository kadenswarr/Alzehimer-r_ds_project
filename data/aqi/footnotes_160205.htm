				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
				<p><p>This indicator can be used to inform policy makers and the public about the degree of potential exposures to fine particles within a state during a year and over time (trends). This is appropriate, as many existing health studies have found the strongest association with health outcomes based on long-term studies; thus, EPA developed the annual NAAQS at 15 &micro;g/m&sup3;. The indicator (annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations) can be compared to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) level of 15 &micro;g/m&sup3; or other health-based standards (although not in a regulatory manner) to communicate the degree of public health concern to policy makers and the general public.<sup>3</sup></p></p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><p>First, EPA extracts the air quality data from the Air Quality System (AQS).  EPA uses the following steps in developing the air data and measures for EPHT air quality indicators.</p><b>Processing raw data</b><p>Step 1: EPA accesses PM<sub>2.5</sub> daily concentrations (mcg/m<sup>3</sup>) based on the current 24-hour PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard (parameter code &#39;88101&#39; and pollutant standard id &#39;21&#39;) and supplemental data fields (e.g. latitude, longitude, elevation) for all the monitoring sites across the US from the EPA&#39;s Data Mart. The data are obtained only from monitors that are designated as Federal Reference Methods or equivalent.  The data include any flagged values associated with exceptional events (high winds, fires, construction, etc) regardless of concurrence by the EPA Regional Office.</p><p>Step 2:  For each monitoring site, retain the maximum concentration at the site for each monitored day.  The pollutant occurrence code (poc) which distinguishes multiple monitors at a single site is listed in the output data set. </p><b>Creating Measures</b><p>Step 3: The annual average measures of PM<sub>2.5</sub> are created using the site-level daily monitoring data. Only monitors that have at least 11 observations for each of the four calendar quarters are considered complete. The annual averages are computed only for monitors that satisfy the completeness criteria.  </p><i><b>Annual average ambient concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub> measure:</b></i><p>Step 4: Select monitors with complete quarterly and annual data using the site-level monitoring data. </p><p>Step 5: Calculate the quarterly average for each calendar quarter and then compute the annual average for each monitor with four valid quarters by averaging the quarterly averages.  If a county has more than one monitor then the maximum annual average among monitors with complete (4 valid quarters) data is assigned as the annual average for that county.</p><i><b>Annual percent of population living in counties exceeding the NAAQS (compared to percent of population living in counties that meet the standard and percent of population living in counties without PM<sub>2.5</sub> monitoring) measure:</b></i><p>Step 6a:  This is a state-level measure and uses the county-level annual average concentrations calculated in step 3.</p><p>Step 6b: To calculate the annual percent of population living in counties that exceed the annual NAAQS, sum the population of all counties that exceed the annual NAAQS and divide by the total population of the state. Multiply this fraction by 100 to get percent.</p><p>Step 6c: To calculate the annual percent of population living in counties that meet the annual NAAQS, sum the population of all counties that meet the annual NAAQS and divide by the total population of the state. Multiply this fraction by 100 to get percent.</p><p>Step 6d: To calculate the annual percent of population living in counties that do not have complete monitors, sum the population of all counties that do not have complete monitors and divide by the total population of the state. Multiply this fraction by 100 to get percent.</p></p>

				<p><b></b></p>
				<p><p>Air monitoring data provides information regarding concentrations around the specific location of each monitor. For PM<sub>2.5</sub> this can be a rather large area, except when unusual local emissions (agricultural fires) occur. Within-county variation in concentrations will likely exist but will not be captured in this measure. Many PM<sub>2.5</sub> monitors measure every third day (some every sixth day) and a few measure every day.</p></p>

				<p><b>Use Constraints</b></p>
				<p><p>This measure provides a general indication of the overall trend in annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations.  It may be affected by density and placement of monitors, and coverage will vary across the country and within states. It does not directly reflect exposure. Certain geographic areas, such as those near busy roads, are likely to have higher values.</p> <p>When creating measures we only consider monitors that have (at least 11 observations per calendar quarter. It is important to understand that this indicator is not for use-compliance determination with NAAQS or reasonable further progress toward attaining compliance.</p> <p>The relationship between ambient concentrations and personal exposure is largely unknown, and it varies depending upon pollutant, activity patterns, and microenvironments.</p> <p>The percentage of state population living in counties with no PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements must always be considered when attempting to estimate the proportion of population at risk.</p></p>
